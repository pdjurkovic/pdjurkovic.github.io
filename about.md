## Skills and Competences (and thoughts)
- __Languages__: English(__C1__), Serbian(__native__)
- __Programming languages__: Using C daily, C++ a bit less these days, assembly when something goes wrong..., sometimes messing around with Python (mostly), Matlab, Ruby, and maybe some other, but would not call myself a skilled user (sometimes heavy googling)...
- __Editors__: whatever keeps me from debugging the toolchain into the wee hours, I'll use it. Yes, I like VS Code but if I would have to spend half of my time fixing the toolchain just so I could use it - not worth it. Not a vi(m) or emacs cultist.
- __Version control__: It's a tool, not the product, most major (commercial) options get the job done IMO (_with some varying degree of ease_), but self-hosted git is as good as them.
- __Standards and processes__: While working on projects I had to comply with international standards like MISRA, ASPICE (derived from ISO/IEC 15504), ISO 26262, WP.29 (UNECE), and a bit of IEC 62304.
- __Other__: I like playing around with electronics, PCB design (initially Eagle, not KiCad), Test and Measurement tools and HW tools in general (a bit of a hoarder). Trying to automate stuff here and there, but without relying on data gobbling services. 3D printing on my Prusa Mini, but my design skills in Fusion 360 are pretty limited.
Almost anything technical can spark my interest...
