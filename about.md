## Experience
### SW Technical Project Lead / SW Developer
[Continental AG](https://continental-automotive.com/)   
_September 2019 - present / May 2018 - August 2019_
- Initially started as a SW developer working on access control devices that include Remote Keyless Entry Systems and handsfree access solution - PASE. Included implementing RF, LF and UWB wireless communication.
- Working with bare metal and custom lightweight RTOS – from low level drivers to application SW, using MISRA subset of C99.
- Activities spread across the entire V cycle – from early concepts to support in production.
- Later moved into the SW responsible role (project lead) fully responsible for the final SW product. My activities expanded into project planning, ensuring timely deliveries fulfilling SW quality standards, mentoring and organization of the team’s time and tasks, as well as planning future projects and activities with PMs and customers.

## Skills and Competences (and thoughts)
- __Languages__: English(__C1__), Serbian(__native__)
- __Programming languages__: Using C daily, C++ a bit less these days, assembly when something goes wrong, occasionally Python for scripting, MATLAB (math and plots/visualization), and maybe some other that I would not call myself a skilled user (heavy googling)...
- __Editors__: whatever keeps me from debugging the toolchain into the wee hours, I'll use it. Yes, I like VS Code but if I would have to spend half of my time fixing the toolchain just so I could use it - not worth it. Not a vi(m) or emacs cultist.
- __Version control__: It's a tool, not the product, most major (commercial) options get the job done IMO (_with some varying degree of ease_).
- __Standards and processes__: While working on projects I had to comply with international standards like MISRA, ASPICE (derived from ISO/IEC 15504), ISO 26262, WP.29 (UNECE), and a bit of IEC 62304.
- __Other__: I like playing around with electronics, PCB design (initially Eagle, now KiCad), Test and Measurement tools and HW tools in general (a bit of a hoarder, I might need help). Trying to automate stuff here and there, but without relying on data gobbling services. 3D printing, but somewhat limited by my design skills in Fusion 360.
Almost anything technical can spark my interest...
